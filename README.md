This app is a todolist which has a **light-mode** and a **dark-mode** which can be changed by clicking on the **moon** or sun **icon**.
The frontend is in **React** and the backend in **Node.js**. I use a postgresql database launched with **docker**.

To launch the backend:

- Make sure you have docker running
- cd in the backend directory
- Enter the command `docker compose up --build`

To launch the frontend:

- cd in the frontend directory
- Enter the command `npm install`
- Then `npm run dev`

To see the app:

- Open your browser
- Paste this URL `http://localhost:5173/`
